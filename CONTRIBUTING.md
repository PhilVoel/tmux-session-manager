## Contributing

If you'd like a feature added, just open an issue and I'll see what I can do. If you want to implement it yourself, feel free to tell me in the issue and open a pull request. I'm always happy to accept contributions.\
Do note that since I have to maintain the codebase, I might not accept every pull request if it doesn't fit the overall goal of the plugin, or ask you to rewrite portions of your code so they fit the overal coding style better.

## Bug

If you find a bug, please report it in the issues. In order to speed up the process, if you feel like parts of your configuration or a session save file might be relevant, please include that information in the issue. If you have already tracked down the issue and know how to fix it, feel free to open a pull request as this will likely be the fastest way of getting the bug fixed.
